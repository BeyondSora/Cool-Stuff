So I decided to actually code up some random, weird stuff I've come across in C++.
Turned out there are a lot of cool things you can do with the language and
some really interesting behaviours.

If you like, you can use the source code however you want to.
(I doubt anyone'd find it useful tho...)

There is a makefile in every folder.
Note: Some code is intentionally made unable to compile in order to
      illustrate some interesting point.
